title: Work-from-home, stay-at-home Mom
---
I've learned a lot about life in the past 14 months. My daughter was born in April 2016. I want to focus this post on working post-baby. 

I had some high, high hopes of what life would look like after having a baby and continuing to work. I was given the unique opportunity to work from home for the indefinite future after 8 weeks of maternity leave. I was so excited to be able to still work and not put my daughter in day care. I did a little work here and there before my maternity leave was up so I could get a feel for how things would work before diving in full-time. Everything seemed pretty smooth and doable. 

I had a few friends who gave me gentle warnings about how hard this might be or how I shouldn't expect to actually get any work done. I thought to myself, "I don't care how hard this is! I'm going to make it work no matter what."

My maternity leave came to an end and I quickly realized that I had almost no control over how many naps my daughter would take or how long those naps would be or how much work I would actually be able to get done that day. There were very good weeks and very bad weeks. I was constantly worried about getting work done while being worried I wasn't spending enough quality time as a mom. It was a balancing act that never felt even. It. Was. Hard. and so mentally draining.

Since March when I started Bloc, I haven't been working. Bloc is still hard to do while I balance caring for my daughter but the thought that I might have also been working with all of this is crazy to think about. I'm scheduled to finish Bloc in September and have decided that will be the time to look for a go-into-the-office job. 
In hind sight, I can't imagine doing things any differently than I did. I'm thankful for the opportunity to work-from-home and the time I got with my daughter. It also amazes me to see what I did accomplish work-wise while caring for an infant. I still have a bit of sanity left too!
