title: My Bloc Experience
---
I've already told you a little bit about how I arrived at the virtual doorstep of Bloc. Let me tell you a bit about my experience so far in the program. 

I came into Bloc with a little bit of HTML and CSS knowledge. I knew just enough to get myself in trouble, which can be good and bad. I was regularly tasked with editing existing Wordpress sites or injecting CSS into Squarespace sites at my graphic design job. I was always open to attempting the edits because I knew that I learned something new every time I started digging around code. I loved it. Looking back, I should have noticed my love for this and made the web dev move long ago. 

Now really looking back, I see how much I had NO IDEA what I was doing. I knew I was going to enjoy Bloc when I had this realization in the first week of the course. That's how quickly you learn. It's incredible. In the first week, I learned more HTML and CSS that I had poking around for years on my own. 

Here's where things get tricky... I went from being so excited about how much I had learned with HTML and CSS to feeling like a brick had hit my face in the form of Javascript. Did I accidentally sign up for a math class? No one told me about this algorithm-jibberish. It was totally overwhelming. (This is hilarious to me now since I know Javascript is the foundation of all things development) Luckily, I had a mentor who was incredibly patient and helpful. We walked through each problem I had troubles with letter-by-letter. I started to feel more and more comfortable. 

Now here I am almost 3 months later and learning more daily than I thought my brain could learn in a month. So far, it's been a rollercoaster ride from "Why did I decide to do this to myself?" to "This is what I was supposed to be doing my whole life!" There's almost no in between for me which is emotionally tough but I'm loving it!
