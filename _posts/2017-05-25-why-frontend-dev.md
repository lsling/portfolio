title: Why I'm making the move to Frontend Development
---
After floundering in college trying to decide on a major, I landed on graphic design. I didn't have an art background at all but took one of those career assessment quizzes and it put me in graphic design or interior design. I loved the idea of being a creative persion but wasn't sure if I actually was creative. I was also slightly swayed by my boyfriend, now husband, who was studying architecture, to move to a more creative field. 

I dove head first into graphic design and immediately loved it. I was also pretty good at it. I got great grades, had two incredible design internships in Dallas, Texas and was jazzed about my future as a graphic designer. After graduation, my husband and I moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan so he could attend grad school at Michigan. I could not find a job. At all. Nothing in any realm of design. I don't even know how many places I sent my portfolio to but it was the worst time in the recession and we were living in Michigan... pretty much the worst of all the states hit. I ended up getting a job working for the local Apple Store, which is another story entirely, but my design career went on pause for 4 years.

We moved to Colorado and after hopping around for a bit, I landed a great job back in graphic design. I was finally doing design again but something was missing. I found myself getting more pumped about troubleshooting computer issues and solving web problems than I did coming up with some new exiciting design concept. I think I would have stayed there for years but I got laid off due to us losing our biggest client and it forced me to take a look at things. 

I live in a town where graphic design opportunities are not plentiful. I started my new job search on the web looking for remote-only design jobs. I had no luck. I began noticing that for every 1 graphic design job listed I saw 5 web dev jobs listed. That sparked my interest. 

I have a some friends in San Francisco who work at start-ups so I reached out. They work with developers daily and had a lot of insight and even pointed me to Bloc. With my semi-tech background and desire to solve problems, I thought maybe this was would be the perfect career shift. After doing a little research on my own after, I decided to go for it. And here I am today, in my third month at Bloc and loving it!
