I am a software engineer currently looking for opportunities in Sarasota, FL or remotely as a Front-end
Developer. I'm experienced in Javascript, jQuery, AngularJS and Ruby on Rails.

I have a BFA in Communication Design from Texas Tech University and am currently finishing up a Full Stack Development course through <a href="https://www.bloc.io/" target="_blank">Bloc.</a> I'm a seasoned graphic designer (check out my design portfolio site <a href="https://laura-slingerland-design.squarespace.com" target="_blank">here</a>) who was looking for a change into a more technical, problem solving career. I recently moved from Telluride, Colorado to Sarasota, Florida with my husband and daughter.
