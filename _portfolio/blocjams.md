## Explanation

Bloc Jams is a project built into the Bloc Web Developer Track curriculum. This project was my first introduction to vanilla Javascript, jQuery, and AngularJS. 

## Problem

I originally built Bloc Jams using vanilla Javscript then refactored into jQuery. The final step was to fully refactor it into AngularJS.

## Solution

When I was building the application initially in Javascript and jQuery, I was given pretty detailed instructions in order to create it. While refactoring into AngularJS, I was given less direction which forced me to dive into learning Angular.

I started the refactoring process with the templates to reduce redundancy in the HTML files and moved over all CSS files since they were already ready to go from the previous jQuery version.

Next, I refactored jQuery functions to use Angular directives for the next, previous and play/pause buttons and created controllers for landing, album and collection views. I was also introduced to Angular's data binding and services here.

Properly written documentation on attributes and functions was covered which I found very helpful. It forced me to fully understand what the attribute or function was doing.

## Results

In order to test my solutions, I utilized node.js to test my progress and get visual confirmation of my solutions.

## Conclusion

Bloc Jams was a great learning experience. Taking an application from jQuery and refactoring to Angular was an interesting way to introduce a new framework. It really showed off the benefits of Angular and I'm excited to learn more and use it in the future.
